**In this project we will build the model Support Vector Machines for classifying Purchased as 0(Not Purchased) or 1(Purchased) from different features in the dataset**.<br></br>  

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for linear or nonlinear classification, regression, and even outlier detection tasks. 
SVMs can be used for a variety of tasks, such as text classification, image classification, spam detection, handwriting identification, gene expression analysis, face detection, and anomaly detection.<br>
SVMs are adaptable and efficient in a variety of applications because they can manage high-dimensional data and nonlinear relationships.


**Important- Note: Explore the dataset once before going through the code.**
